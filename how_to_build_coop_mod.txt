OpenXcom Co-op Mod (OXCE v8.4) — Build (Visual Studio 2022)

1. Open the Visual Studio 2022 solution from the repository.

2. All required third-party dependencies are already included in the deps folder, so you do not need to download libraries from the internet.

3. The solution defaults to x64 and uses the DLL dependencies.

4. If you want to build x86, select Platform = Win32 and Configuration = Release.

5. If you want to build a static version, the static libraries are available under deps/static_libraries. That folder also contains a linker input list (linker_input_list.txt) for the static build. You can copy its contents and paste them into Visual Studio → Linker → Input → Additional Dependencies.

6. If you need help, you can contact us by email, on Discord, or via the mod’s pages.
